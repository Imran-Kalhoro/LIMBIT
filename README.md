# Limb Inertial Measurement Bracelet for Infant Tracking (LIMBIT)

The Limb Inertial Measurement Bracelet for Infant Tracking (LIMBIT) is constructed from a thin, flexible printed circuit board made from polyimide substrate material and created using the photolithography method. Various silicon integrated circuit chips are attached to this board using surface mount technology. The device is comprised of 4 main compartments connected by serpentine interconnects, providing mechanical integrity while enhancing flexibility. A key feature of LIMBIT is its light weight and small size. The device measures 58.5x23.5x3.5mm. Weighing only 3 grams, the device is specifically designed for use on preterm infants, who often have a birth weight of less than 2.5 kg. The reduced weight and size of the device helps limit interference of natural, spontaneous limb movements. In addition, the bendable serpentine interconnections allows LIMBIT to be folded and compressed to even smaller dimensions, further reducing any interference of natural limb activity or clinical care.
